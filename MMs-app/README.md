This Shiny app allows the user to perform chi-squared goodness-of-fit testing on the color distribution of Milk Chocolate M&Ms candies. The app assumes the following color distribution.

Blue: 24%

Brown: 13%

Green: 16%

Orange: 20%

Red: 13%

Yellow: 14%

The user can input the following.

1. Frequencies for each color
2. The level of significance for the test.

The app produces the following output.

1. A table containing the observed and expected frequencies for each color, together with that color's contribution to the total chi-squared value.
2. The total number of M&Ms in the sample.
3. The chi-squared value for the data.
4. The P-value for the data, using 5 degrees of freedom.
5. A conclusion to the goodness-of-fit test, determined by comparing the P-value with the chosen level of significance.
6. A bar chart comparing the observed and expected values for each color.
